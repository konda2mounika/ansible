# ```

# 1. Create a user for running the application

# ```sql
# # useradd roboshop
# ```

# 1. Download the repo.

# ```sql
# $ cd /home/roboshop
# $ curl -L -s -o /tmp/payment.zip "https://github.com/stans-robot-project/payment/archive/main.zip"
# $ unzip /tmp/payment.zip
# $ mv payment-main payment
# ```

# 1. Install the dependencies

# ```bash
# # cd /home/roboshop/payment 
# # pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# ```

# ### **Note: Above command may fail with permission denied, So run as root user**

# 1. Update the `roboshop` user id and group id in `payment.ini` file .
